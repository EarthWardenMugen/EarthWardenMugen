- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EarthWardenMugen
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of Python.
- ðŸ“« you can find me at EarthWardenMugen@protonmail.com.

I'm just screwing around for now, so I figure I'll post my code scribbles to get familiar with Github while I'm at it. 
For now don't mind me, I'll update things once I feel competant enough to contribute.
